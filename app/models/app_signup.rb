        <ul>
          <li><strong>Get Dirty</strong> - Roll up your sleeves! You should be learning new things frequently enough to stay challenged, but don't be afraid to practice what you're learning; you're there to both learn and be helpful!</li>
          <li><strong>Be Curious</strong> - Ask what it's like to run a small business, how she got to where she is in her field, and the challenges she's had along the way - it's likely that you've experienced some of the same stuff.</li>
          <li><strong>Ask for Feedback</strong> - Remember to ask for gentle but constructive feedback. You'll gain the best kind of real-life experience when you're learning from your mistakes.</li>
          <li><strong>Share Goals</strong> - Get to know each others goals and dreams! We want to help you build a mentor network because we're all stronger when we learn together.</li>
