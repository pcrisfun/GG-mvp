I agree to attend the safety orientation at the beginning of the Session and will not operate any equipment or use any materials without first familiarizing myself without their safe use. I agree that under no circumstances will I operate or use any tools, equipment, machinery or any other materials or substances at the Facility which have not been expressly mentioned during the safety orientation as being included and associated with participation in the Session. If I believe anything to be unsafe, I will immediately notify a member of the Girls Guild staff.

            3.
