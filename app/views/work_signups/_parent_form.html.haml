            PARTICIPATION WAIVER AND RELEASE AGREEMENT PLEASE READ CAREFULLY BEFORE SIGNING. THIS IS A RELEASE OF LIABILITY AND WAIVER OF CERTAIN LEGAL RIGHTS.
            In consideration for my being permitted by GirlsGuild to participate in the workshop titled #{@work_signup.event.title} (the “Session”) being held at #{@work_signup.event.location_address} #{@work_signup.event.location_address2} #{@work_signup.event.location_city} #{@work_signup.event.location_state} #{@work_signup.event.location_zipcode} (the “Facility”), I hereby agree to the following waiver and release:

            1. I understand that my participation in the Session may include the use and operation of inherently dangerous tools, equipment, machines, chemicals and other hazardous materials and/or substances.

            2. I agree to attend the safety orientation at the beginning of the Session and will not operate any equipment or use any materials without first familiarizing myself without their safe use. I agree that under no circumstances will I operate or use any tools, equipment, machinery or any other materials or substances at the Facility which have not been expressly mentioned during the safety orientation as being included and associated with participation in the Session. If I believe anything to be unsafe, I will immediately notify a member of the GirlsGuild staff.

            3. I, ON BEHALF OF MYSELF AND EACH OF MY HEIRS, LEGAL REPRESENTATIVES, SUCCESSORS AND ANYONE ELSE WHO MAY ACT ON MY BEHALF, KNOWINGLY AND INTENTIONALLY WAIVE AND RELEASE, INDEMNIFY AND HOLD HARMLESS GIRLSGUILD AND ANY OF ITS OFFICERS, AGENTS, SERVANTS, EMPLOYEES, CONTRACTORS, ASSIGNS, AND ALL PERSONS, NATURAL OR CORPORATE, IN PRIVITY WITH GIRLSGUILD from and against any and all claims, actions, damages, liability, costs, and expenses, in connection with any loss of life, any injury or damage to person or property or any other type of injury or damage (including reasonable attorney’s fees) of any kind or nature whatsoever, whether foreseen or unforeseen, arising directly or indirectly out of or resulting from my participation in the Session, including without limitation, any damage to my property or any injury or death to me, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER ANY SUCH LOSS, LIABILITY, CLAIM OR DAMAGE RESULTS FROM THE SOLE, CONTRIBUTORY, PARTIAL, JOINT, COMPARATIVE OR CONCURRENT NEGLIGENCE OF GIRLSGUILD OR ANY OF ITS OFFICERS, AGENTS, SERVANTS, EMPLOYEES, CONTRACTORS, ASSIGNS, ALL PERSONS NATURAL OR CORPORATE, IN PRIVITY WITH GIRLSGUILD OR ANY OF THE FOREGOING PERSONS, OR ANY OTHER PERSON PARTICIPATING IN THE SESSION UNDER THE EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INVITATION OF GIRLSGUILD.

            4. I will exercise the highest degree of care in my use of all tools, equipment, machinery, and other materials and/or substances to avoid damages to all equipment used during my participation in the Session and to avoid damage to the Facility and all fixtures and contents therein. I agree to indemnify and reimburse GirlsGuild and/or the owner of the Facility, as applicable, for all damage that I cause to any equipment, infrastructure or any other improvements and facilities.
