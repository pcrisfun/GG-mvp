Callen was born in Melrose, Florida, a sleepy town with 27 lakes and one stoplight. She was raised in the woods, in a house her parents built by hand. As a sixth-generation Floridian, Callen was taught by her grandmother to always respect the land, especially in a state that cedes often to the interests of development. Her work reflects this love for the land through abstracted desert spaces, mountains, and biomorphic patterning. She aims to visually knit geographies of memory based on human experiences on the land.",

We like to think outside of the box about how materials can be used, and are interested in innovating in playful, exciting ways. We currently have three Production Assistants that you will be working closely with, and the environment in the studio is very lighthearted. While we all have a lot of work to get done, we can often be found doing it to a soundtrack of cheesy pop music.

We will draw, paint, etch and collage directly on 16mm film to create beautiful and rhythmic animations. Cameraless, or direct, animation is the practice of applying materials directly to clear 16mm leader or developed film. The result is gorgeous, abstract animations that are filled with surprising life and movement. We will use found objects from nature: leaves, feathers, and insect wings, as well as transparencies, lighting gels, film negatives, inks, stamps, and more to manipulate our film. In the weeks after the workshop, Lee will scan in the film and send each class member a digital copy of the beautiful, finished work. ",
